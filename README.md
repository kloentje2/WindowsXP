This website was created due to an assigment from my school, (portfolio website)
As I got a suggestion on a vertical Navigation by @firedingo I thought of the Menu bar of Windows.
And as Windows XP was the best in that, I thought: "Let's theme the website around Windows XP and let it look like it"
And thats how this page started.
